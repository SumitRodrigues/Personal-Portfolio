# Personal Portfolio PWA

This is a personal portfolio project that has been converted into a Progressive Web App (PWA). It showcases my work experience, skills, and projects in a responsive and interactive manner.

## Features

- Responsive design that works on various devices
- Offline functionality through service worker caching
- Installation capability on devices as a PWA
- Smooth animations using Framer Motion

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps:

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (version 14 or higher)
- npm (Node Package Manager)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/personal-portfolio.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd personal-portfolio
   ```

3. Install the dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

### Running the App

To run the app in development mode, use the following command:
```bash
npm start
```
This will start the development server and open the app in your default web browser.

### Building for Production

To create a production build of the app, run:
```bash
npm run build
```
This will generate a `build` directory with optimized files for deployment.

### PWA Features

- **Manifest**: The app includes a `manifest.json` file that defines how the app appears when installed on a device.
- **Service Worker**: A service worker is registered to enable offline capabilities and caching of assets.

## Usage

You can view the portfolio online or install it on your device for a native app experience. The app is designed to be user-friendly and showcases my skills and experiences effectively.
